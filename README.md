# 🎓 Emotion Detection from Text – RISE Project

**Project Title**: Emotion Detection in Educational and Mental Health Communication  
**Program**: RISE (Research Internships for Skill Enhancement)  
**Context**: AI-based NLP model for use in Tamizhan Skills LMS and student mentoring

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Student communication (e.g., LMS feedback, messages, chatbot conversations) can reflect their mental and emotional states. These emotional signals, if analyzed correctly, can be used to:

- Identify students in need of support
- Tailor feedback or intervention
- Improve student engagement and well-being

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a machine learning model that classifies input text into emotional categories such as:

- `joy`
- `sadness`
- `anger`
- `fear`
- `love`
- `surprise`

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Accepts plain English text messages
- Preprocesses text (lowercase, clean, remove stopwords)
- Vectorizes input using **TF-IDF**
- Trained using **Logistic Regression**
- Returns predicted emotion
- Evaluated using **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**

📌 Expected Outcome
This project serves as a foundation for emotion-aware applications in:

📚 Tamizhan Skills LMS: Auto-analyze feedback for emotional tone

🧑‍🏫 Mentorship platforms: Alert mentors to stressed or disengaged students

🤖 Chatbots: Tailor responses based on user's emotional state

🔄 Future Scope
Integration with chatbot frontends (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram)

Real-time emotion dashboards for educators

Support for multi-lingual inputs (e.g., Tamil + English)

Deep learning (RNN/LSTM) upgrade
